  <h1>BUILD & FIGHT</h1>
</div>

SpaceCraft was released in **2018**. It is a **single-player** game where players engage in combat using their own custom-built spaceships. As players progress through various levels, they earn money which can be spent on purchasing building blocks to construct and upgrade their spaceships.

Each spaceship must be equipped with essential components: weapons, propulsion systems, and a control unit. The control unit is crucial; if it is destroyed, the entire spaceship is rendered inoperable. Similarly, if all propulsion blocks are destroyed, the spaceship loses its ability to maneuver.

The game features multiple types of weapons that players can switch between and fire independently, allowing for strategic combat. Each block used in the construction of the spaceship has unique properties and varying amounts of health. When a block's health is depleted, it disintegrates, affecting the overall integrity and performance of the spaceship.
