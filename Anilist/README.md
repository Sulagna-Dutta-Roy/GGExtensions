# AniList API

The AniList API provides access to a wide range of information about anime and manga. This document will guide you through the process of using the API to search for anime titles and retrieve their details.

## Getting Started

To use the AniList API, you'll need to obtain an API key by signing up for an AniList account and creating an application. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Sign Up**: If you don't already have an account, sign up for an AniList account at [AniList](https://anilist.co).

2. **Create Application**: Once logged in, go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new application. This will generate an API key that you'll use to authenticate your requests.

3. **API Key**: Copy the generated API key. You'll need to include this key in your API requests as an authorization header.

## Making Requests

The AniList API uses GraphQL for querying data. Here's an example of how to make a simple request to search for anime titles:

```graphql
query ($title: String) {
    Page {
        media (search: $title, type: ANIME) {
            id
            title {
                romaji
                english
                native
            }
            description
            averageScore
            coverImage {
                large
                medium
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This query searches for anime titles matching the provided title string and retrieves their ID, titles in different languages, descriptions, average scores, and cover images.

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, include your API key as an authorization header in your HTTP requests. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from the AniList Developer Dashboard.

## Rate Limiting

The AniList API has rate limits to prevent abuse. Be sure to check the [API documentation](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) for the most up-to-date information on rate limits and usage guidelines.
